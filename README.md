# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

## Goal of the project
To understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users on Google Play and App Store.

## Data sets:
There are two sets of data (downloaded from Kaggle). 
1. [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018. 

2. [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017. 

Because the end goal is to develop and add an app that's going to be profitable on both Google Play and App Store, we need to find app profiles that are successful on both markets. (For instance, a profile that works well for both markets might be a productivity app that makes use of gamification.)

In this project, I'm taking different ways to clean and eye-ball the data, and examine the popularity of particular kinds of apps using frequency tables. 

## Materials:
* `AppleStore.csv`: data on apps in Apple Store
* `googleplaystore.csv`: data on apps in Goole Play Store
* `ProfitableAppProfiles.ipynb`: data cleaning and analysis
